# Moving eyes Project
> A project that show two eyes following the user's cursor.

## Description
> The original code was showing an eye following the user's cursor. The first exercice was to create a second eye. Both of them are now following the cursor. I added two functions that change randomly the size of the eye ball and their color. This was a good way to make this project my own from the original code but also to understand it how it works better.

## How to run
> Simply launch the index.html on your browser and you are good to go.

## Roadmap of future improvements
> You could add a function and a button that let the user create new eyes in the DOM.

## Contacts
> For future projects, you can follow me or contact me through my portfolio: https://drenhat.github.io/

## License information
> The code is an improvement from an MIT xPro exercise
