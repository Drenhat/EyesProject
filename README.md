# Moving eyes Project
> A project that show two eyes following the user's cursor.

## Description
> The original project was to create a second eye. I added some random size and color for the eye balls.

## How to run
> Simply launch the index.html on your browser and you are good to go.

## Roadmap of future improvements
> You could add a function and a button that let the user create new eyes in the DOM.

## Contacts

## License information
